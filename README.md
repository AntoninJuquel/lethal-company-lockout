# Lockout

### Lockout the facility for a certain amount of time.

## Information

After a period of time a popup will appear on your screen telling you that the facility is locked out therefore you will neither be able to enter it nor exit it by the **Main Entrance** but you can still exit it by the **Fire Exit**.

After another period of time a popup will inform you that the facility is unlocked again, letting you enter by the **Main Entrance** again and exit by any door.

You can only enter the facility by the **Main Entrance** because **Fire Exit** are locked from the inside.

## Configuration

You can configure the time before the facility is locked out and unlocked again in the config file generated after launching the game with the mod once.
