# Lockout

### Lockout the facility for a certain amount of time.

## Important

## Information

After a period of time a popup will appear on your screen telling you that the facility is locked out therefore you will neither be able to enter it nor exit it by the **Main Entrance** but you can still exit it by the **Fire Exit**.

After another period of time a popup will inform you that the facility is unlocked again, letting you enter by the **Main Entrance** again and exit by any door.
